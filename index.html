      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Filip Ilic</strong>, a seasoned WordPress developer based in <strong>Belgrade, Serbia</strong>, with a career in web development that began back in <strong>2007</strong>. Over the years, I've had the chance to work on a wide range of projects, from high-profile sites to premium themes and long-term product development.</p>

      <p>One of the highlights of my career was building the official website for <strong><a href="https://novakdjokovic.com" target="_blank">Novak Djokovic</a></strong> in <strong>2012</strong> — a fun, challenging, and memorable experience that pushed my skills to the next level.</p>

      <p>From <strong>2013 to 2017</strong>, I was active on <strong>ThemeForest</strong>, where I created and sold premium WordPress themes under the name <a href="https://themeforest.net/user/pukkathemes" target="_blank">pukkathemes</a>. This chapter gave me great insight into the needs of everyday users and how to design flexible, easy-to-use WordPress solutions.</p>

      <p>Around the same time, in <strong>2016 and 2017</strong>, I worked with clients through <strong><a href="https://toptal.com" target="_blank">Toptal</a></strong>, briefly exploring the freelance world on a global scale.</p>

      <p>From <strong>2017 to 2022</strong>, I was part of the <strong><a href="https://avada.com" target="_blank">Avada</a></strong> team — one of the most popular WordPress themes out there. I contributed to the product's evolution, focusing on performance, stability, and bringing new features to life.</p>

      <p>These days, I'm a <strong>Software Engineer at <a href="https://emilia.capital" target="_blank">Emilia Capital</a></strong>, where I continue to develop custom backend features and tools for internal use.</p>

      <p>Outside of my day job, I enjoy building clean and scalable WordPress solutions — but I wouldn't call myself an "open-source contributor." I've mostly focused on real-world projects and client-driven work rather than publishing plugins or contributing to the WordPress core.</p>

      <p>If you'd like to connect or see some of my work, feel free to visit me on <a href="https://rs.linkedin.com/in/filip-ilic-942b0251" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://github.com/f-ilic" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
